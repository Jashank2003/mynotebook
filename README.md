# myNotebook - A MERN Stack Project


## Description

myNotebook is a fully functional web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It serves as a simple note-taking application where users can create, view, edit, and delete their notes.

The project demonstrates how the MERN stack works and how React interacts with the backend to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes. It also showcases the integration of MongoDB as the database, Express as the backend framework, and Node.js as the runtime environment.

## Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out to manage their notes securely.
- Create and View Notes: Authenticated users can create new notes and view their existing notes in a user-friendly interface.
- Edit and Delete Notes: Users can easily edit the content of their notes or delete them when they are no longer needed.
- API Calls: The frontend makes API calls to the backend to fetch, save, update, and delete notes in the database.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Backend: Node.js and Express - For building a robust and scalable server-side application.
- Database: MongoDB - A NoSQL database used to store and retrieve note data.
- Axios: A popular library for making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies for the backend and frontend using npm or yarn.
4. Set up your MongoDB connection string in the backend to ensure database connectivity.
5. Run the backend server using `npm start` or any other appropriate command.
6. Run the frontend application using `npm start` or any other appropriate command.
7. Access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I have gained valuable insights into the following aspects:

- Understanding React Components and State Management.
- Building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express.
- Integrating MongoDB as the database and performing CRUD operations.
- Handling user authentication and security in web applications.
- Making API calls from the frontend to the backend using Axios.

## Future Improvements

List any additional features or improvements you plan to implement in the future.Although its in working stage but i will upgrade its desgin
